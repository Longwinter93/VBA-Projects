# VBA-Projects
The VBA projects were created by modifying projects from Internet in order to meet my requirements and automate my tasks.
I used my knowledge of the VBA syntax to modify these projects.
I did it with respect to one of programming rules "do not reinvent the wheel"
The knowledge of the syntax of VBA is useful so as to automate tasks in Excel.
